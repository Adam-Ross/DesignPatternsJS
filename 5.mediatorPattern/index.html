                constructor() {

      Basically, the best way to look at this is to think of the chatroom as the mediator, and the users as what is
      being mediated to. The mediator is a go between for all users that can centralize code that all users have access
      to. You just have to add the users to the this.users in the chatroom prototype.
    </div>
    <div class="para">
      Let's take a look at the User class first.

    <pre>
            <code class='largerCode'>
                class User {
                  constructor(name) {
                    this.name = name;
                    this.chatroom = null;
                  }
                
                  send(message, to) {
                    this.chatroom.send(message, this, to);
                  }
                
                  recieve(message, from) {
                    console.log(`To: ${this.name} 
                    From: ${from.name}: ${message}`);
                  }
                }
            </code>
          </pre>
    <div class="para">
      So, what is going on here. <br><br>
      First, we have a user being created that gets a name, and access to a chatroom that is set up as null on the
      prototype.
      <br>
      It also gets access to two methods. The send and recieve. These are bascially for handling sent message and
      reciving them as well. It is also to pass in the 'this' keyword into the chatroom
    </div>

    <pre>
      <code class='largerCode'>
          class Chatroom {
            constructor() {
              this.users = {};
            }
          
            register(user) {
              this.users[user.name] = user;
              user.chatroom = this;
            }
          
            send(message, from, to) {
              if (to) {
                to.recieve(message, from);
              } else {
                for (let key in this.users) {
                  if (this.users[key] !== from) {
                    this.users[key].recieve(message, from);
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <div class="para">
      Next, we have the actual chatroom class. An instance of a chatroom is initialized with a blank object for USERS
      and has methods for sending and reciving messages, as well as adding users to the chatroom (register).

      <br><br>
      The register method takes in an instance of a user, adds it to the users prototype object within the chatroom.

      <br><br>

      Next, we have a send method. Send actually handles send and recive for each user. If there is no 'to' arguemtn
      provided, the method delivers the message to all users that are not the 'from' arguemnt. It's tricky, but ya know
      the basics now.
