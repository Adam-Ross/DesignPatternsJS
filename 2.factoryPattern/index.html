    <h1 id='main-title'>Factory Pattern</h1>
    <div class="question">
      So, when would be a good time to use the factory pattern?
    </div>
    <p class='para'> Well, let's say that you were creating a
      bunch of objects that had some of the same qualities, but different at the same time. Example might be if you were
      making objects that represented a persons subscription rate... So might be gold memebers, some platinum, some
      silver, and some shit tier... Ya know..
      <br>
      <br>
      Another reason you might use this factory pattern is if you were creating new employees with different job
      titles... They are all employees, but some are janitors, some are engineers, some are teachers, ect. They are all
      employees, but they are different. Let's take a look at the code.
    </p>




    <div class="subHeading">
      This might get a bit tricky...
    </div>
    <p class='para'> - First, let's list out things we have to do:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class='collection-item'> - Create facotry for making members (memberFacotry)
        This will have to take in a NAME and a TYPE as args
      </li>
      <li class='collection-item'> - Check to see what type is, and create new object based on that subClass.</li>
      <li class='collection-item'> - Add the type property to member</li>

      <li class='collection-item'> - Add the method DEFINE on the member</li>

      <li class='collection-item'> - Return the member</li>
    </ul>

      <code class='codeBlock'>
          function MemberFactory() {

              if (type === "simple") {
