    <p class='para'>Ok, so what is goign on there... We've already got the code in the supporting files, so I might only
      include them when needed. Basically, getting the gist of what is going on here is the most important thing.</p>
    <p class='para'>So, what is the <span class='highlight'>OBSERVER PATTERN</span>? Basically, it's a programming
      pattern that allows observer classes to access the state of a specific model. </p>

    <p class='para'>Think about it in these terms. You store some state within one class, and trickle it down to all
      other classes whenever an given event happens. In our case above, it is the click event or the 'increment' button
      being clicked. When that button is clicked, the state of the model is updated. The state of the nubmer is
      incremented, and the state of the color changes to a random color. Now, even though the model is handeling that
      state, the actual components, or subclasses are the ones handling the updating of the dom. The numberObserver
      handles that changing of the number, the colorObserver handles that color, and the consoleObserver handles all the
      output to the console. It's actually quite smart when you think about it. Once you get your head around it, it's
      not bad at all. </p>

    model.addObserver(numberObserver);
